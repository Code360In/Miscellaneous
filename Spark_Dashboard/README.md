## Build an Online Performance Dashboard for Apache Spark

This note outlines the main steps in building a performance dashboard for Apache Spark
using InfluxDB and Grafana. The dashboard is useful for performance troubleshooting and
online monitoring. 

### Understand the architecture
![Spark metrics dashboard architecture](images/Spark_metrics_dashboard_arch.PNG "Spark metrics dashboard architecture")

Spark is instrumented with the [Dropwizard/Codahale metrics library](https://metrics.dropwizard.io).
Several components of Spark are instrumented with metrics, see also the 
[spark monitoring guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics), 
notably the driver and executors components are instrumented with multiple metrics each.
In addition, Spark provides various sink solutions for the metrics. 
This work makes use of the Spark Graphite sink and utilizes InfluxDB with a graphite 
endpoint to collect the metrics. Finally, Grafana is used for querying InfluxDB and 
plotting the graphs (see architectural diagram below).
An important architectural detail of the metrics system is that the metrics are sent directly
from the sources to the sink. This is important when running in distributed mode.
Each Spark executor, for example, will sink directly the metrics to InfluxDB.
By contrast, the WebUI/Eventlog instrumentation of Spark uses the Spark Listener Bus and metrics
flow through the driver in that case 
([see this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucaCanali/sparkMeasure/master/docs/sparkMeasure_architecture_diagram.png)
for further details).
The number of metrics instrumenting Spark components is quite large. 
You can find a [list of the available metrics at this link](Spark_dropwizard_metrics_info.md)

### Simplified configuration and rollout
- See the repository [Spark Dashboard](https://github.com/cerndb/spark-dashboard) for a simplified procedure to 
  configure and run the dashboard using InfluxDB and Grafana.
- The steps 2-to-4 below detail how to do the configuration if you prefer to install it yourself.

### Manual config, step 1: Install and configure InfluxDB
- Download and install InfluxDB from https://www.influxdata.com
  - Note: this requires InfluxDB v1.x as it has a Graphite endpoint which has been removed in InfluxDB 2.x
- Edit the config file `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf` and enable the graphite endpoint
- **Key step:** Setup the templates configuration
  - This instructs InfluxDB on how to map data received on the graphite endpoint to the measurements and tags in the DB
  - The configuration used for this work is provided at: [influxDB graphite endpoint configuration snippet](influxdb.conf_GRAPHITE)  
- Optionally configure other InfluxDB parameters of interest as data location and retention
- Start/restart influxDB service: systemctl restart influxdb.service
- If needed, open the firewall port (port 2003 by default)

###  Step 2: Configure Grafana and prepare/import the dashboard
- Download and install Grafana 
  - download rpm from https://grafana.com/ and start Grafana service: `systemctl start grafana-server.service`
     - Note: For the older/legacy Spark_Perf_Dashboard_v01 do not use Grafana 7.4.0 or higher
- Alternative: run Grafana on a Docker container: http://docs.grafana.org/installation/docker/
- Connect to the Grafana web interface as admin and configure
  - By default: http://yourGrafanaMachine:3000
  - If needed, open the firewall port (port 3000 by default) 
  - Create a data source to connect to InfluxDB. 
    - Set the http URL with the correct port number, default: http://yourInfluxdbMachine:8086
    - Set the InfluxDB database name: default is graphite (no password)
  - **Key step:** Prepare the dashboard. 
    - To get started import the example Grafana dashboard [Spark_Perf_Dashboard_v03](Spark_Perf_Dashboard_v03.json)
    - You can also experiment with building your dashboard or augmenting the example.

### Step 3: Prepare Spark configuration to sink metrics to graphite endpoint in InfluxDB
There are a few alternative ways on how to do this, depending on your environment and preferences.
One way is to set a list of configuration parameters of the type `spark.metrics.conf.xx`
another is editing the file `$SPARK_CONF_DIR/metrics.properties`
Configuration for the metrics sink need to be provided to all the components being traced
(each component will connect directly to the sink).
See details at [Spark_metrics_config_options](Spark_metrics_config_options.md)
Example:  
  ```
  $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.driver.sink.graphite.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.GraphiteSink" \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.executor.sink.graphite.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.GraphiteSink" \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.host"="graphiteEndPoint_influxDB_hostName>" \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.port"=<graphite_listening_port> \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.period"=10 \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.unit"=seconds \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.prefix"="lucatest" \
  --conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.source.jvm.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource"
  ```

### Step 4: Start using the dashboard
- Run Spark workload, for example run Spark shell (with the configuration parameters of Step 3)
  - An example of workload to see some values populated in the dashboard is to run a query as: 
`spark.time(sql("select count(*) from range(10000) cross join range(1000) cross join range(100)").show)`
  - Another example is to run TPCDS benchmark, see https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf

The configuration is finished, now you can test the dashboard.
Run Spark using the configuration as in Step 4 and start a test workload.
Open the web page of the Grafana dashboard:

- A drop-down list should appear on top left of the dashboard page, select the application you want to monitor. 
Metrics related to the selected application should start being populated as time and workload progresses.
- If you use the dashboard to measure a workload that has already been running for some time,
note to set the Grafana time range selector (top right of the dashboard) to a suitable time window
- For best results test this using Spark 3.x
(note Spark 2.4 and 2.3 will also work, but it will not populate all the graphs/metrics)
- The instrumentation works with Spark on a cluster manager (for example YARN or Kubernetes).
  Use this instrumentation for Spark in local mode only with Spark 3.1 or higher.

**Dashboard view:** The following links show an example and general overview of the example dashboard,
measuring a test workload.
You can find there a large number of graphs and gauges, however that is still a small selection
 of the [available metrics in Spark instrumentation](Spark_dropwizard_metrics_info.md).
For reference, the test workload is 
 [Spark TPCDS benchmark](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf) at scale 100 GB, running on a test 
 YARN cluster, using 24 executors, with 5 cores and 12 GB of RAM each.

### Spark metrics dashboard with query/job/stage annotations

**Main ideas:** 
- Grafana "[annotations provide a way to mark points on the graph with rich events](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/annotations/)".
- You can use this to mark important point in the
graph, with details about the start or end time of queries, jobs, stages.
- Grafana allows to add annotation [queries using an InfluxDB source](https://grafana.com/docs/features/datasources/influxdb/#annotations) 
- If you log the query/job/stage start and time into an InfluxDB instance, you can use that information as
a data source to add annotation to the Grafana dashboard. 
- The motivation for this is that it allows you to relate
metrics and resource utilization with meaningful data about the workload and answer questions like:
which query/Spark job caused the CPU utilization spike at time X? How much shuffle did I use for a given job? etc. 

**Recipe** to add Spark query/job/stage information to the Spark performance dashboard:
- Log Spark execution information (query/job/stage start and end time) to an InfluxDB instance.
For this use [sparkMeasure](https://github.com/LucaCanali/sparkMeasure) in Flight recorder mode
with [InfluxDB Sink](https://github.com/LucaCanali/sparkMeasure/blob/master/docs/Flight_recorder_DBwrite.md)
as in this example:
```
bin/spark-shell --master local[*] --packages ch.cern.sparkmeasure:spark-measure_2.11:0.15 \
--conf spark.sparkmeasure.influxdbURL="http://myInfluxDB:8086" 
--conf spark.extraListeners=ch.cern.sparkmeasure.InfluxDBSink
```

- Import the [example Grafana dashboard_with_annotations](Spark_Perf_Dashboard_v03_with_annotations.json)
and set up the data source for annotations to point to the InfluxDB instance.
  The DB name used by sparkMeasure by default is "sparkmeasure"
 
- An example of the result is show below (see "Example Grafana dashboard with annotations")

### Run in a standalone Docker container or on Kubernetes using a Helm Chart

The repository [**spark-dashboard**](https://github.com/cerndb/spark-dashboard) supports the installation
of the Spark Performance Dashboard using containers technology.  
Two different installation options are packaged in the repository, use the one that suits your environment best:
- [dockerfiles](https://github.com/cerndb/spark-dashboard/tree/master/dockerfiles) -> Docker build files for a Docker container image, use this to deploy the Spark Dashboard using Docker.
- [charts](https://github.com/cerndb/spark-dashboard/tree/master/charts) -> a Helm chart for deploying the Spark Dashboard on Kubernetes.

### Example Graphs

The next step is to further drill down in understanding Spark metrics, the dashboard graphs
and in general investigate how the dashboard can help you troubleshoot your application
performance. One way to start is to run a simple workload that you can understand and reproduce.
In the following you will find example graphs from a simple Spark SQL query reading a Parquet table from HDFS.
- The query used is `spark.sql("select * from web_sales where ws_list_price=10.123456").show`
- `web_sales` is a 1.3 TB table from the Spark [TPCDS benchmark](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf) generated at scale 10000.
- What the query does is reading the entire table, applying the given filter and finally returning an empty result set.
This query is used as a "trick to the Spark engine" to force a full read of the table and intentionally avoiding optimization, like Parquet filter pushdown. 
- This follows the discussion of [Diving into Spark and Parquet Workloads, by Example](https://db-blog.web.cern.ch/blog/luca-canali/2017-06-diving-spark-and-parquet-workloads-example) 
- Infrastructure and resources allocated: the Spark Session ran on a test YARN cluster,
using 24 executors, with 5 cores and 12 GB of RAM each.

**Graph: Number of Active Tasks**  
![Graph: Number of Active Tasks](images/Graph_number_active_tasks.PNG "NUMBER ACTIVE TASKS")  
One key metric when troubleshooting distributed workloads is the graph of the number of active sessions as a
function of time.
This shows how Spark is able to make use of the available cores allocated by the executors.

**Graph: JVM CPU Usage**  
![Graph: JVM CPU Usage*](images/Graph_JVM_CPU.PNG "JVM CPU USAGE")    
CPU used by the executors is another key metric to understand the workload.
The dashboard also reports the [CPU consumed by tasks](images/Graph_task_CPU_time.PNG), the difference is that the
CPU consumed by the JVM includes for example of the CPU used by Garbage collection and more.  
Garbage collection can take an important amount of time, in particular when processing large amounts of data
 as in this case, see [Graph: JVM Garbage Collection Time](images/Graph_garbage_collection.PNG "JVM Garbage Collection Time")

**Graph: Time components**  
![Graph: Time components](images/Graph_Time_components.PNG "Graph: Time components")  
Decomposing the run time in component run time and/or wait time can be of help to pinpoint the bottlenecks.
In this graph you can see that CPU time and Garbage collection are important components of the workload.
A large component of time, between the "executor run time" and the sum of "cpu time and GC time" is not instrumented.
From previous studies and by knowing the workload, we can take the educated guess that this is the read time.
See also the discussion at [Diving into Spark and Parquet Workloads, by Example](https://db-blog.web.cern.ch/blog/luca-canali/2017-06-diving-spark-and-parquet-workloads-example)

**Graph: HDFS read throughput**  
![Graph: HDFS read throughput](images/Graph_HDFS_read_throughput.PNG "HDFS read thorughput")   
Reading from HDFS is an important part of this workload.
In this graph you can see the measured throughput using HDFS instrumentation exported via the Spark metrics system
into the dashboard.

**Example Grafana dashboard with annotations**  
![Graph: Grafana dashboard with query start time annotations](images/Spark_dashboard_with_annotations.PNG "Grafana dashboard with annotations")
This picture shows an example of Grafana dashboard displaying Spark metrics and augmented with annotations
of query start time. Each vertical line is a new query being run. Details on the query id can be found
by drilling down on the graphs. Details on how this is run are describe above at "Spark metrics dashboard with query/job/stage annotations".
